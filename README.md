A partial replication of Cochrane's Defence of return predictability using python
This is not a complete replication because we only go as far as simulating the dividend growth and return coefficients.
If you have not fully understood the paper or think that its too long you should check out

The blog above does the complete replication using R
NOTE: you'll have to change the directory to your data on the first line of the code and also change your column headers to those indicated

Any support to do the full replication is welcome
